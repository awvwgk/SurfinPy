#### Author - Adam Symington

##### Contained here are 11 tutorials for using surfinpy in your research. 

It should be noted that these are generic examples to demonstrate the functionality of the code. 

- Notebooks/Surfaces/Tutorial 1 - Guide to generating a phase diagram for a surface as a function of the chemical potetnial of two variable species.
- Notebooks/Surfaces/Tutorial 2 - Guide to convert the chemcial potential values used in tutorial 1 into meaningful values.
- Notebooks/Surfaces/Tutorial 3 - Guide to convert chemical potential to pressure.
- Notebooks/Surfaces/Tutroial 4 - Guide for creating a phase diagram for a surface as a function of temperature and pressure. 
- Notebooks/Surfaces/Tutorial 5 - Guide to generate particle morphologies - requires an installed version of pymatgen. 

- Notebooks/Bulk/Tutorial 1 - Guide to generating a phase diagram for a bulk material as a function of the chemical potential of two variable species e.g. MgO + $CO_2$ + $H_2O$.
- Notebooks/Bulk/Tutorial 2 - Guide to including temperature in a bulk phase diagram.
- Notebooks/Bulk/Tutorial 3 - Guide to convert chemical potential to pressure.
- Notebooks/Bulk/Tutroial 4 - Guide for creating a phase diagram for a bulk material as a function of temperature and pressure. 
- Notebooks/Bulk/Tutorial 5 - Guide to calculating and including vibrational entropy in a phase diagram.
- Notebooks/Bulk/Tutorial 6 - Guide to calculating and including vibrational entropy in a temperature dependent phase diagram.

In the Scripts/ you will find the tutorials but in python script format.
