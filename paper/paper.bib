abstract = {Radiolytic corrosion of actinide materials represent an issue for the long term storage and disposal of nuclear materials. Molecular species adsorbed at the surface of the actinides may impact the rate of radiolysis, and as the surfaces corrode, the soluble toxic and radioactive species leach into groundwater. It is therefore critical to characterise the surface composition of actinides. Here, we employ ab initio modelling to determine the surface composition of PuO2 with respect to adsorbed CO2. We found that CO2 interacts strongly with the surface forming carbonate species. By mapping the energetics of this interaction, we then calculate the temperature of desorption, finding that surface morphology has a strong impact on the adsorption of CO2, with the {\{}100{\}} being the most and the {\{}111{\}} the least affected by carbonation. Finally, we predict the effect of carbonation on the morphology of PuO2 nanoparticles as a function of temperature and pressure, finding that truncated octahedral is the preferred morphology. This modelling strategy helps characterise surface compensition and nanoparticle morphology, and we discuss the implication for radiolytically driven dispersal of material into the environment.},

abstract = {The surface structure and composition of functional materials are well known to be critically important factors controlling the surface reactivity. However, when doped the surface composition will change and the challenge is to identify its impact on important surface processes and nanoparticle morphologies. We have begun to address this by using a combination of density functional theory and potential-based methods to investigate the effect of surface dopants on water adsorption and morphology of the technologically important material, CeO2, which finds application as electrolyte in SOFCs, catalyst in soot combustion, and enzyme mimetic agent in biomedicine. We show that by mapping CeO2 surface phase diagrams we can predict nanoparticle morphologies as a function of dopant, temperature and water partial pressure. Our results show that a low temperature, un-doped CeO2 nanocubes with active {\{}100{\}} surface sites are thermodynamically stable. But at the typical high temperature operating},
