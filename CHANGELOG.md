- Data is no longer stored in dictionaries. A new `surfinpy.data` module has been developed to store the information from ab initio calculations. 
- `surfinpy.bulk_mu_vs_mu` and `surfinpy.bulk_mu_vs_t` have been added to allow phase diagrams of bulk phases to be generated.
- `surfinpy.vibrational_data` has been added to allow the vibrational entropy and zero point energy to be calculated and added to the phase diagrams. 
- `surfinpy.plotting` has been added and `surfinpy.chemical_potential_plot` and `surfinpy.pvt_plot` have been moved here.
